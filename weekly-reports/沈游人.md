Unsound tools: These tools sacrifice maximization of finding bugs to minimizing false positives to a reasonable level. So, these tools are intentionally imprecise & undecidable - this means possible false positives & false negatives.

Sound tools/Formal tools: These tools report all defects checked for & produces no false negatives. These are relatively slower. but, produces a large amount of false positives.

- 下周计划：

		1. Run and test SVA.
		2. Try to survey why people don't like to develop at kernel. I don't think it's simply because it could crash the whole system with slight problem in Kernel.


- 其他事宜：

		Still confused about what I should do and I think I should read more paper.
