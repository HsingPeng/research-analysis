本周工作进展和下周计划

参考例子：

2017.02.18~2017.02.24

- 本周工作计划点1: Reread the paper of SVA.

- 完成情况：Can understand the approach and the problem it solved, but can't understand why it can solve the problem. 

- 本周工作计划点2: Read the paper of SAFECode. 

- 完成情况：Totally can't understand the sound analysis

...

- 下周计划：

		1. Run and test SVA.
		2. Try to survey why people don't like to develop at kernel. I don't think it's simply because it could crash the whole system with slight problem in Kernel.


- 其他事宜：

		Still confused about what I should do and I think I should read more paper.
