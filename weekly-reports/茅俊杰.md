# 2017.2.20 - 2017.2.24

Add mathematical contents in the paper (refer to git@enight.me:seda/paper.git for details).

Next week: Start filling the technical parts, both with data (if now available)
and detailed descriptions.

>> chy: Good, and you can send tasks to Li dong, cc me.

# 2017.2.27 - 2017.3.3

1. Collect various characteristics of the previously selected patches, and put them into the paper.
1. Add a background section to the paper. An example that will be discussed throughout the paper is also added.
1. Fix various bugs in unit tests, PDG isomorphism, pattern extraction, etc.
1. Attend several discussions on the seda project.

Next week: Motivate the techniques we adopt by the empirical study, and use the example introduced this week to make the technical parts concrete. Also add some related work if there is time.

# 2017.3.5 - 2017.3.10

1. Add data of the empirical study into the paper
1. Explain macro-annotated AST and change untangling using the example given in Section 2.

Next week: Go back to the code to deal with context-related stuff and complex changes.

# 2017.3.13 - 2017.3.17

1. Some enhancements to SeDA:
  * Fix matching of PDG function arguments
  * Also analyze files using any changed functions (except direct calls)
  * Consider functions passed as function arguments as another kind of context.
  * Disable the costly pre-process which involves IPA but is useless in the current scenario. As a result, the limit of functions analyzed for a single commit is raised from 15 to 25.
  * Infer inclusion changes.
  * Fix PDG alignment and AST pattern extraction.
  * Adjust PDG/CDG pattern merging.
  
  To summarize, 11 out of 13 commits involving callbacks now have sufficient information for the cocci backend.
  
Next week: Go back to the paper and prepare a slide for presentation.

# 2017.3.20 - 2017.3.24

1. Make a draft slide on SeDA and present it in the group.
2. Go over the related research fields, namely patch inference (both empirical studies and techniques), automated refactoring and clone detection, and fill in the related work section in the paper.
3. Fix a few reported bugs in the SeDA code.

Next week: Go back to the code, try a simpler-to-explain way of untangling, grouping and abstraction, and start collecting evaluation results for the paper.
