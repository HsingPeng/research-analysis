# Performance overhead of SGX
## EENTER and EEXIT overhead

Once an enclave want to invoke an OCALL(Call service outside enclave from inside), it must EEXIT and EENTER later. The typical example is syscall.
Here is the log file:
Info: executing thread synchronization, please wait...
TSC overhead: 26
System call request from encalve tooks 7521 cycles
Pid result: 32701
System call native tooks 165 cycles
Pid: 32701

System call from native system only cost 165 cycles but once you want to invoke it from Enclave, it will cost 7500 cycles.
